**Project:** Machine Learning for RF Spectrum Sensing

**Project Description:**  
The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to identify and classify radio frequency (RF) signals from various wireless communication sources. Using software-defined radio (SDR) devices, we will capture RF spectrum data and analyze it using machine learning models to differentiate between different types of wireless signals, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

**Problem Definition:**  
The primary challenge is accurately classifying RF signals from a variety of wireless devices and environments. This involves efficiently collecting data, preprocessing it, and applying machine learning algorithms that can adapt to different RF conditions and signal types.

## Deliverables
- Fully operational SDR data collection system
- Cleaned and processed RF data
- Preliminary machine learning models for RF signal classification
- Final project report
- GUI for signal classification and data visualization
