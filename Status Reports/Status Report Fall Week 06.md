## 1) Accomplishments This Week ##
   - Held the sixth weekly meeting to discuss ongoing research and progress on SDR data collection.
   - Worked on getting the SDR devices fully operational and successfully developed a working GNU script for data collection.
   - Focused on refining data collection methods and understanding the RF signals.
   - Continued research into RF signal processing and machine learning models for future integration.

## 2) Milestones to Be Completed Next Week ##
   - Continue to refine SDR data collection process and assess data quality.
   - Begin preliminary analysis of the collected data and prepare it for integration with machine learning models.

## 3) Issues, Problems, or Concerns ##
