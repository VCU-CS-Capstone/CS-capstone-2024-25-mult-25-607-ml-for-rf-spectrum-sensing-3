## 1) Accomplishments this week  
- Used opensorce RF data, built the initial CNN, and verified data preprocessing.
- Conducted initial training runs and identified signs of overfitting in the model.  

---

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week  
- Add regularization, optimize hyperparameters, build a GUI prototype, and test with new data.  

---

## 3) Issues, problems, or concerns  
- Overfitting persists, dataset accuracy needs review, and GUI requirements need clarification.
