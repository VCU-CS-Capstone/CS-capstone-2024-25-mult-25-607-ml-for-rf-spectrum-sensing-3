## 1) Accomplishments this week  
- Completed initial data collection using IQ RF datasets, ensuring proper segmentation into WiFi, Bluetooth, and None classes.  
- Designed and implemented the first iteration of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for signal classification.  
- Verified the data preprocessing pipeline, including normalization and dataset splitting (training, validation, testing).  
- Conducted initial training runs and identified signs of overfitting in the model.  

---

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week  
- Implement regularization techniques (dropout layers and L2 weight decay) to reduce overfitting.  
- Begin hyperparameter optimization using grid search for better model performance.  
- Develop the initial prototype of the GUI for real-time PSD data input and model prediction.  
- Test the model with unseen data to evaluate its accuracy and robustness.  

---

## 3) Issues, problems, or concerns  
- Overfitting observed in the initial training runs; further regularization is required to improve generalization.  
- Ensuring the accuracy of labeled datasets as real-world RF signals may introduce noise and ambiguity.  
- Need clarification on specific visualization requirements for the GUI from mentors and advisors.
